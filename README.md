        <h1>Hello beings of the species Homo Sapians (or bots)</h1>
        <p>I'm a neurodivergent unfortunate who dabbles in the art of bending chronically overpriced and incredibly recalcitrant hunks of silcon to my will.  I attempt to exercise my sovereignty over these intractable processors with the aid of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and a paltry amount of Commodore 64 BASIC.  (Adjectives such as trifling, microscopic, infinitesimal, and minute are adequete in describing the vast expance of my knowladge in these languages.)  I occastionally practice and exercise these advanced skills, mainly to wash my desk, clean my tear ducts, and wear my mouse down clicking the restart button.  Using my extensive and vast knowladge, I create webpages that would dazzle 1980s devs, games delicately copied line by line from tutorials (not writing comments is a skill unto itself,) and staring at the greek language website other call Stack Overflow, before using the trusted ctrl c.  <br>  When I'm not exerting my dominance over my overpriced silicon, I attempt to create pleasing sounds via Symphony Orchestra, Concert Band, Choir, and anything between. 
 In said world, one can break the rules with no concern of pesky syntax errors, but must remember that only Avant Garde critics will praise it.  While proper form and syntax are indespesible in computer programming because otherwise the blasted idiot of a computer will refuse to process your commands, proper form and syntax can be despensed for music, but only if you are idiot or a genius.  <br> In addition to being a composer, I am also bassoonist, someone who blows on an hollowed out piece of wood through some grass, and hopes a legible sound comes out the other end.  Bassoons, like programming skills, require regular practice, something I do theortically.</p>
